An exciting, music based start-up is looking for a VP of Engineering to join the team.

This company focuses on helping expand the music community through live events, building marketplace platforms to allow people to see great musicians in cities all over the world. These gigs are real intimate, secret affairs, allowing the audience to interact and learn about artists big and small.

<b>About the Role</b>

The role involves helping scale this team from a smaller, lesser known start-up, to being a real player in their industry. The company believes that structure, culture and engineering practice must come from the top-down first, and are looking to get this VP in place before starting to hire more engineers in place. This role involves building and operating the platform across all areas, whether that be the fans, the musicians or the event hosts themselves.

As well as this, working closely alongside the rest of the leadership team to strategise the roadmap going forward for the product, and understanding the technical execution needed to hit all necessary goals.

<b>What skills do you need?</b>

The predominant skills needed for this role are about previous experience and knowledge in helping scale start-ups, ecommerce, marketplace platforms or ticketing based systems.

As part of this, having an understanding of how to expand technology teams, and support across tech, dev ops and new products will be necessary.
